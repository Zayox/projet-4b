  <h1 id="intro">Introduction :</h1>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is a science that brings together theories and techniques aimed at developing machines capable of getting as close as possible to human reasoning or behavior. It is often based on powerful algorithms that determine its efficiency, quality of analysis and understanding. In our study, we will focus on the possibility of being able to interact, or even communicate directly with a software, a conversational agent called chatbot.
    First of all, we will give a general definition of what a chatbot is. Then, we will explain how this technology works to see its possible limits. Finally, we will see why the demand for chatbots is more and more present in companies.

  <h1 id="chatbot">What is a chatbot?</h1>

  <p>
    It is a software or application that simulates a text or voice communication with a human being based on algorithms. This robot is often linked to your messaging agent such as messenger, skype, slack or whatsapp, in order to offer you services. Chatbots are more and more integrated in companies' information systems so that employees or customers can easily interact with applications.
    The first Eliza chatbot was created in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His program was designed to simulate a discussion between a psychotherapist and his patient by rephrasing most of the answers to restart the conversation.

    Later, PARRY was written in 1972 by psychiatrist Kenneth Colby at Stanford University. The purpose of this chatbot is to simulate a person with schizophrenia.
    Today, you all know new chatbots that have more features such as Google and Apple's intelligent PDAs, Siri and Google home.
  </p>

  <h1 id="technology">How does this technology work?</h1>
  <p>To use a chatbot, you have to go through a text or voice messaging agent to be able to chat with your user. The robot must also be able to process and organize a large amount of information. It is then necessary to have a CPU and an adapted memory, i.e. an artificial brain, for the proper functioning of the machine.

    To be able to function and be efficient, the chatbot must also "understand" what the interlocutor is writing or saying. In other words, he must be able to analyze the terms of the user's request in order to easily give a structured, clear and adapted answer.

    To do this, chatbots must be able to process and classify text. <br><br>Chatbot developers then have the choice between various processes:

    Classify the text by pattern matchers. Here the chatbot has at its disposal a large database in which there are many pre-recorded answers. Each of these answers is related to a question whose construction or important words are defined in the chatbot's database. A request entered by the user then gives in output a pre-recorded answer. The artificial intelligence company Pandorabots claims to have been able to design more than 285,000 chatbots with this method.

    Classify the text by algorithm. The chatbot again has a database with pre-recorded responses. <br><br>However, unlike the previous process, the user's sentence construction does not need to be precise. Indeed, the algorithm used by the chatbot analyzes each word of the sentence in isolation. Each term is then assigned to a class of information to be defined by a root word and linked to other words. All the terms entered after classification will then be linked together to correspond to a specific pre-recorded response. The NTLK human language data processing platform is an example of a tool that allows this type of classification.
    Classify the text by artificial neural network. <br><br>This system uses the same principle as the previous processes except that this time, no answer is pre-recorded. Indeed, each term, in addition to being analyzed individually and classified, is interconnected to one or more groups of information. The words entered by the user will then correspond to a "neuron" of the neural system. The different activated neurons create a link between them that will then gradually build the answer. To ensure its accuracy, the answer then passes back into the neural system.


    As a result of its various processes, we can see two categories of chatbots:

    Chatbots with so-called "weak" interactions: that is to say that each question is planned in advance by the human being so that the chatbot can give a reliable and coherent answer thanks to a precise analysis of the keywords of the user's request.

    Chatbots with so-called "strong" interactions using Artificial Intelligence are able to conduct a conversation autonomously, and even show humor and emotion.
  </p>
    <h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
    <p>However, chatbots may face some limitations. Indeed, lack of information in a database or incomplete text classification can limit the chatbot's efficiency. Most chatbots are often lost in the face of spelling mistakes.

      However, the development of new technologies and artificial intelligence allows to counter more and more these defects.

      Indeed, to complete the database of their chatbot, developers have at their disposal application programming interfaces called APIs. These APIs are a set of protocols and information libraries that can be integrated into software or, in our case, chatbots.

      By using this tool, the chatbot can get new information from other software or websites and thus offer brand new services. Sprout Social is an example of an API to visualize data from Facebook and Twitter platforms.

      Chatbots can also use the Machine Learning principle to increase their performance. Indeed, this consists in basing themselves on past conversations with a user to adapt their analysis and answers. It is a way to efficiently collect new data and adapt the chatbot's behavior. The chatbot can then progressively give more natural responses that are closer to what a human could respond.
    </p>
    <h1 id="companies">Chatbots in companies</h1>
    <p>These improvements in operation and efficiency are one of the many arguments that drive companies to equip themselves with a chatbot. Indeed, companies are increasingly using chatbots to answer many questions 24 hours a day, quickly, efficiently and at a reduced cost. Chatbots also have the advantage of being able to record the information of regular customers and thus facilitate the entire purchasing process, which can increase the company's sales rate. For a chatbot to be within a company, the chatbot must have a relevant response rate of at least 80%.

      Let's take the example of the Ouisncf website and its chatbot which is an example in this matter.
      With this chatbot, we can have access to all the trains of the SNCF network and their schedules. We can also know their availabilities and book them directly via the chatbot.
